                Apple uses the white space principle of design on their homepage and it make the design looks very organized and focused. They put the latest phone in their collection in the centre of the page and nothing else but a few links. A simple but beautiful page also because of the great photos

                The BYU-Idaho website also uses the design principle of alignment on their page and it makes navigation of the page easy and not too cumbersome for a school website. It is laid out in a certain order which makes things easy to find on the page.

                The Tesla page uses the "rule of thirds" principle of design to put the various models of their cars and solar panels in the middle of the screen upon every scroll in such a way that it is appealing to the eye. The rul of thirds is usually used with website with image backgrounds.
